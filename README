/*
 * Simple hacky app to send UDP packets used to control power of a remote device
 * Set hostname, port and the three UDP messages as user defined preferences in Settings Menu
 * Select which UDP message to send using the spinner/dropdown on the main screen 
 * The UI thread shows and (bit nasty) also temporarily stores the values of host, port and selected message to send when SEND button hit
 * (That could be improved!)
 * Some error conditions not yet handled well (such as empty values in hostname)
 * Uses Android Annotations https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations
 * Inspired by the code snippet for boxeeremote at http://code.google.com/p/boxeeremote/wiki/AndroidUDP
 * Developed at the Melbourne Android Australia User Group for the Global Android Dev Camp 17-19th Feb 2012.
 * Thanks to Glenn and Guy; James for organizing and Daniel for the venue.
